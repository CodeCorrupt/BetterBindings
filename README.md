# Better Bindings for BeamNG.drive
This contains a handfull of "Quality of Life" keybinds to make your rig feel just a little more real.

## Cruise Control
Every car I've owned has had set/decrement and resume/increment cruise control setpoint on the same buttons.
This mod adds new keybinds for Set, Resume, and Cancel that will act more like what I expect from a production vehicle.

## Headlights
BeamNG doesn't have binding to directly set headlights to high/low/off. This just simply adds bindings to the existing functions.

## Install
Download the `.zip` from the latest release and place it in BeamNG's `mods` filder. If you're on windows, this is most likely at `%LocalAppData%\BeamNG.drive\<version_number>\mods`.

## Usage
Once installed, you should see new bindings show up in `Options -> Controls -> Vehicle` near the bottom.
